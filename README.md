# he-throw-bot
This is a simple discord bot that posts a video compilation of a cockatiel throw things on the ground once an hour.

## Why?
Someone asked me for it.

## How do I use this?
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## What is a pip? Why is there a python?
> Pip is an orphan. Why *wouldn't* there be a python?
